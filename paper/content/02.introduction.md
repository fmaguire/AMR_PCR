## Introduction {#intro}

- Why is AMR bad?

- What's the solution?
Among other things improved surveillance

- How are we doing this surveillance?
Genomics are more common, transcriptomics are relatively rare, trying to pick-up metagenomics
We used to and still should use PCR

- What is good about PCR?
Cheap, effective, requires low DNA (can you do it direct from samples?), requirements are a lot cheaper, lighter and simpler than second-gen.
No computational requirements, no need to compare sequence to database, can just check length on a gel.
Sanger sequencing of PCR is still the total gold-standard for proving assessment etc (assembly followed by PCR paper to confirm HGTs etc? Tardigrade?)
qPCR is a thing too (can you use same primers for quant as you would for non-quant?)
3rd generation sequencing is getting there (lab in a bag etc)

- What is bad about PCR?
Needs primers, limited insert size
Primers need to match
Can tolerate some mismatches but are more sensitive to 3' mismatches and insertions/gaps
PCR quality assessment and justification for how I've done this

- EUCAST primers
DO they still recommend these? Find links? Find papers still using them?


- CARD resistomes (modify from Brian's ASM abstract)
What is CARD
Why is it great (curated cut-offs, multiple detection model)
What is RGI?
How did they do resistomes and why did they choose the organisms
What has been the benefits of this? More stored allelic diversity 


- VAware
What it is and how it works
SeqAN
